This application allows users to exchange text messages between each other. 

Everyone can create an account with their own user image, they can search for other users and

chat with them. 

As for now, the user can only send text messages, however soon I would like to add the option to send files, pictures and emojis.

When it comes to plans for upgrades, there is a lot of things to create or improve but I would like to start with:

- Creating error handlers
- Adding a ‘forget password’ function
- Create animations
- Add more user options e.g. change password, change name, avatar and more.
- Add the option to customise the app by each user (chat colours etc.)

I hope that you'll like this project and find it interesting.
